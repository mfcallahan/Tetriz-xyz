Thank you to [Michael Kar�n](https://github.com/melcor76) for providing a great tutorial on how to create a Tetris game with Angular: ["Game Development: Tetris in Angular"](https://indepth.dev/game-development-tetris-in-angular/). This article was very helpful in the creation of my Tetriz game. His original source code can be viewed here: [ng-tetris](https://github.com/melcor76/ng-tetris).
